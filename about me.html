<p>Awal graduated from Obafemi Awolowo University with a Second Class Lower Division. My time there shaped me in many ways and taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of growth.

I got into web development out of pure curiosity. I’ve always been fascinated by how websites work behind the scenes the “mystery” of turning ideas into something people can see and use online. What started as curiosity gradually became something I genuinely enjoy learning and building.

Outside of tech, I’m a big football lover. I enjoy watching and playing whenever I can. Football, for me, is more than just a game. it’s about teamwork, passion, and staying consistent.

And yes, I’m not single 😊</p>
